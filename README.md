## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP

Consulted and communicated clearly with client to see what they wanted and their vision of the site.  Their main goal was to allow the users to know what they do and who they are as well as providing enough information to intrigue the uses.  The client also wanted to ensure there were several areas of the page to show their number so that the user is more willing to contact them.  I did a wireframe for the client and pinpoint the exact spots where I would implement which information and pinpoint where the videos/phone numbers would be.  I wanted to page to flow naturally with the information about the company like a story, which I feel like I accomplished. 

## Optimizations

I would add a gallery section instead of only providing short clips of youtube videos for the users to visual see the client's work.  


## Lessons Learned:

I learned to not use too many different types of program and tools to try to make the site as intricate as possible, I ran into my headaches because of this.  I should KISP.
